# Welcome

The Shiny Explorer is a tool for exploring data. Simply load some datasets on the left, and then you can:

- Do some cool stuff
- Do some other cool stuff
- And even more cool stuff!

Shiny Explorer assumes that your data is tidy before you load it, so you might have to do 
some cleaning yourself. But after that, it should be easy for you to do all sorts of (even non-trivial) stuff.
